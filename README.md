## WPGuidelines is a Wordpress theme for brand guideline projects.
Based on the Twenty Twenty-four starter theme, it has built-in support for the new, more intuitive site editor.
This theme builds on that base with custom blocks, patterns and templates aimed at making the experience of building guidelines easy for designers, not just coders.

### Features
- Table of contents generated automatically based on the page's header tags. Has options for # of levels, automatic expansion on scroll, and vertical/horizontal layout. Built on top of [Tocbot](https://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/) (custom block) 
- Hover over section titles to show an anchor icon, click to copy their anchor URLs
- Interactive type tester to show off typography (custom block)
- Before/after image comparison, useful for showing grids (custom block)
- Image styles for correct/incorrect usage (block styles)
- Block patterns for common content sections

### Work in progress
- Automatic PDF generation
- Sensible page templates for commonly seen guideline layouts

### Wishlist
- Adobe Fonts integration
- Better site search that incorporates page anchors
